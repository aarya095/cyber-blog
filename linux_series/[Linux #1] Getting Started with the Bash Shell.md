<h1>[Linux #1] Getting Started with the Bash Shell</h1>

Disclaimer: This article documents my personal learning journey in cybersecurity. It is for educational purposes only and not professional advice or guidance for real-world systems. Content reflects my current understanding and may evolve as I learn more.

<h2>Why learn bash?</h2> 
<p>Learning to use a shell is essential in cybersecurity, as many applications are used, installed, managed via a terminal. Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is basically the place where we execute commands, bash is one of the shells along side zsh and other shells. Firstly, hit ctrl+alt+t to launch the terminal, or use the app launcher to open the terminal.

In the below image, it shows the necessary information we need to know before executing a command: </p>

The format of the above is as follows: username@hostname:current_directory$

Here, username is the name of the user currently using the shell (in this case its aarya), hostname is the name given to the computer in the computer network (in this case its Aarya), current_directory is the self explanatory i.e. this part displays the current directory (in this case its ~ i.e. the home directory).

The format of a command in bash is as follows: command [options] [arguments]. For e.g.

<p>`ls -l /home`</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Iâ€™ll conclude my article here, on the note that linux and shell scripting is a vast subject and I am looking forward to learn and explore linux and scripting, by starting with bash, and excited to keep sharing my learning progress!
